# Don't Touch the Spikes - C#

Developed as a university course project for C# Programming, using Godot 4.x. The goal was to incorporate as many C# features and syntactic sugar as possible, even if it didnâ€™t always make sense in some places. The project was completed over the course of a few days.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/m1zukash1/dont-touch-the-spikes-cs.git
   ```
2. Open the project in the Godot Engine. It's that simple ðŸ™ƒ

## Contributing & Future Plans
This was developed as a university project with no future plans for further development. The project is purely here to showcase my work.
